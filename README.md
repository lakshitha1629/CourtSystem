# CourtSystem

##  Description: 
A civilized society encourages its citizens to solve any conflict arises among them through the court system. However, with the increase in the number of conflicts referred to courts to be solved through judicial adjudication. The time taken to reach an end gradually increased, to a point where citizens looked upon the judicial adjudicatory system as an archaic form of adjudication. So as the time -consuming process, the traditional court system consists of several defects that are inherent to it; including, but not limited to less opportunities for the marginalized groups to access, high costs, use of pressure; inducement, and threat in investigations by the law enforcement authorities. Though, methods of alternative disputes resolution were introduced to reduce the huge backlog of cases. Alternative dispute resolution methods are only an alternative, not a substitute for the traditional judiciary system. On the other hand, all other drawbacks except reducing delays, were unsolved by alternative resolution methods for decades. Due to the fact that alternative dispute resolution methods are not a substitute for the traditional method, the most favorable solutions for the mentioned issues lie with mechanisms that increase the efficiency of the judicial system
